Summer 2021 EDNS 151 Design 1

My team designed a works like prototype for an game-like learning platform that allows teachers to upload curriculum to match 
what students are learning in class. The platform is unlocked after a student buys a physical bookmark and enters the code into
the platform. The platform's goal is to create a positive feedback loop by leveling up and gaining acheivements by playing levels/quizzes
for the curriculum.

Tiana Nguyen and I worked on the code for the project.
